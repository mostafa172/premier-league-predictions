# Notification System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up both email and browser push notifications for the Premier League Predictions app.

## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies** (already added to package.json):
   ```bash
   npm install nodemailer node-cron
   npm install --save-dev @types/nodemailer @types/node-cron
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** - Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   # Email Configuration
   EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_PORT=587
   EMAIL_SECURE=false
   EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
   EMAIL_FROM=Premier League Predictions <your_email@gmail.com>
   
   # Frontend URL (for email links)
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:4200
   ```

3. **Gmail Setup** (Recommended):
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication on your Gmail account
   - Generate an App Password: Google Account â†’ Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Use the 16-character app password as `EMAIL_PASS`

### How Email Notifications Work

- **Automatic Scheduling**: Runs every hour checking for fixtures with deadlines exactly 24 hours away
- **User Targeting**: Sends to all registered users
- **Gameweek Focus**: Groups by gameweek and sends reminders for the first match deadline
- **Rich HTML Emails**: Beautiful templates with match details and direct links

### Testing Email Notifications

```bash
# Test connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/test-connection

# Send test email
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:3000/api/notifications/test-email
```

## ðŸ”” Browser Push Notifications

### Frontend Setup

1. **Service Worker**: The `sw.js` file is already created in the frontend `src` folder
2. **Notification Service**: `NotificationService` handles browser notifications
3. **Permission Component**: `NotificationPermissionComponent` provides UI for requesting permissions

### How Browser Notifications Work

- **Permission Request**: Users can enable notifications through the UI
- **Local Notifications**: Shows immediate notifications for reminders
- **Service Worker**: Handles push notifications (requires VAPID keys for production)
- **Click Handling**: Opens the app when notifications are clicked

### Testing Browser Notifications

1. **Enable Notifications**: Use the permission component on the predictions page
2. **Test Notification**: Click the "Test Notification" button
3. **Check Console**: Look for service worker registration logs

## ðŸš€ Production Setup

### Email (Production)

For production, consider using a dedicated email service:

- **SendGrid**: Professional email delivery
- **Mailgun**: Developer-friendly email API
- **Amazon SES**: Cost-effective for high volume

Example SendGrid setup:
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=apikey
EMAIL_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key
```

### Browser Notifications (Production)

For production push notifications, you need:

1. **VAPID Keys**: Generate with `npx web-push generate-vapid-keys`
2. **Service Worker**: Update the VAPID public key in `sw.js`
3. **Backend Integration**: Add push subscription storage and sending

## ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

To make this a PWA with notifications:

1. **Add Manifest**: Create `manifest.json` for app installation
2. **Service Worker**: Already implemented
3. **Offline Support**: Add caching strategies
4. **App Icons**: Add various icon sizes

### iOS Safari

- iOS Safari has limited notification support
- Consider email as primary notification method
- PWA installation works on iOS 11.3+

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Email Issues

**Not sending emails:**
- Check SMTP credentials
- Verify 2FA is enabled (Gmail)
- Use app passwords, not regular passwords
- Check firewall/network restrictions

**Connection issues:**
- Verify SMTP host and port
- Test with different email provider
- Check if provider blocks automated emails

### Browser Notification Issues

**Permission denied:**
- Clear browser data and try again
- Check browser notification settings
- Test in incognito mode

**Service worker not registering:**
- Ensure `sw.js` is in the root of your build
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify HTTPS in production

**Notifications not showing:**
- Check if notifications are enabled in browser
- Verify service worker is active
- Test with simple notification first

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Email Monitoring

- Check server logs for email sending status
